# Kraken
This simple script could be used by peneteration testers and security researchers to:
1) Scan for open ports using nmap library.
2) Find subdomains. 
3) Find if the target is vulnreable to XSS attacks. 
4) Find if the target is vulnerable to Click_Jacking attacks. 

This is just a startup and more features, and functionalities are coming up. The script asks for the target's domain name to start working, and then it will ask for a wordlist if ( Find hidden directories option is chosen so make sure you have a good wordlist in place to start the attack), comments and feedbacks are appreciated.
